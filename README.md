### مرحبا / Hi !

I like [Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model), I mean all of them, not just [Transformers](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). I am interested in [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [Computational Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), they are different somehow! 

I am working in parallel on several tracks of NLP, including but not limited to Language Modeling, Information Extraction, and Conversational AI. At the same time, 
I am doing my [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/).

I am a member of the newly established, [KUIS AI Lab](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/), at the same time I am working as a project engineer at the [EMW project](https://emw.ku.edu.tr/?staff=ali-safaya).
