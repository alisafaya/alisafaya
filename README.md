<h3 align="center">  Merhaba / مرحبا / Hi  👋🏼  !</h3>

I like [Language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model), I mean all of them, not just [Transformers](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). I am interested in [Computational Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), especially, [Natural Language Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding), and [Reading Comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension).

I am working in parallel on several tracks of NLP, including, but not limited to Language Modeling, Information Extraction, and Conversational AI. At the same time, 
I am doing my PhD at [Koç University AI Lab](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/), here is my empty Google Scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j5mgvE4AAAAJ&hl=en) 😄
