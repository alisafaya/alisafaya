<h3 align="center">  Merhaba / مرحبا / Hi  👋🏼  !</h3>

I like [Language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model), I mean all of them, not just [Transformers](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). I am interested in [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [Computational Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), they are [different](https://www.quora.com/How-is-computational-linguistics-different-from-natural-language-processing?share=1)!

I am working in parallel on several tracks of NLP, including, but not limited to Language Modeling, Information Extraction, and Conversational AI. At the same time, 
I am doing my PhD at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/), here is my empty Google Scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j5mgvE4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) 😄

I am a fellow of [KUIS AI Lab](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/), at the same time I am working as a project engineer at the [EMW project](https://emw.ku.edu.tr/?staff=ali-safaya).
